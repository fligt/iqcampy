<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Our lab, the Rijkserfgoedlaboratorium in Amsterdam, recently acquired a
light weight, mobile and user friendly Specim IQcam spectral camera for
the investigation of artworks. The open source Python package `iqcampy`
is developed in the open to learn how to read, visualize and interpret
the spectral image data for this camera.

We hope to release an installable package soon. If you are interested,
and cannot wait, take a look at the documentation and Jupyter notebooks
in his repository.

Letâ€™s dive in!!
